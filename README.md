PROFESSIONAL WEBSITE

## About The Project

This project was to create a professional portfolio to be used as a place to showcase my projects and skillset as a developer. This website will serve as a landing page for all of my developer projects, and it will be sent to potential employers so they can see my skills and projects. 

### Built With

* HTML 
* CSS

## Getting Started

In order to acess this website, just visit the following webpage: [https://andrewbreytenbach.github.io/professional-portfolio-website/]   (Professional-Portfolio-Website)

To get a local copy up and running, simply view the index.html file or the style.css file and see how you can play around, copy, and edit the fle for personal usage. 

## Usage

When the user first visits the webpage, they will find a very generic 'About Me' section that give some brief information about me:

![Header image of the webpage](/images/header1.png.png "About Me")

Under the 'Work' section, this is what the user will see:

![Section with all of my work projects](/images/header2.png.png "Work Projects")

This is an excellent place to view some of the projects I havee worked on. For example, but clicking on the 'Project 1' image, then you will be redirected to my Project 1 page. There the user can see my files, such as html and css files, and in the future even javascript files. 

Additionally, if the user wishes to reach me personally by contacting me, then they can click on any of the 'Contact Me' links at the bottom of the webpage:

![Section with all of my contact info](/images/Header3.png.png "Contact Me")

Perhaps the best way to reach me would be by visiting my LinkedIn.
